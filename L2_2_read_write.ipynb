    "\n",
    "One of the first steps of many analysis workflows is to read data from a file, one of the last steps often involves writing data to an output file. To the horror of many geoinformatics scholars, there exist many file formats for GIS data: the old and hated but also loved and established [ESRI Shapefile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapefile), the universal [Geopackage (GPKG)](https://www.geopackage.org/), and the web-optimised [GeoJSON](https://geojson.org/) are just a few of the more well-known examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fear not, Python can read them all (no guarantees, though)!\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the current Python GIS packages rely on the [GDAL/OGR libraries](https://gdal.org/), for which modern interfaces exist in the form of the [fiona](https://fiona.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [rasterio](https://rasterio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) Python packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, we’ll concentrate on vector data, so let’s first take a closer look at fiona’s capabilities, and then import and export data using [geopandas](https://geopandas.org/), which uses fiona under its hood.\n"
