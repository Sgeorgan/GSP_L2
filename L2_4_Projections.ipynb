    "**Coordinate reference systems** (CRS) are essential metadata for any geospatial dataset. Without a CRS, geometries would simply be a collection of coordinates in an arbitrary space. Only the CRS allows GIS software, including the Python packages we use in this course, to relate these coordinates to a place on Earth, or other roughly spherical objects or planets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Often confused with CRS, map projections, also known as **projected coordinate systems**, are mathematical models that enable the transfer of coordinates on the surface of our three-dimensional Earth to coordinates on a planar surface, such as a flat, two-dimensional map. Unlike projected coordinate systems, geographic coordinate systems use only latitude and longitude, which are the degrees along the horizontal and vertical great circles of a sphere approximating the Earth, as the x and y coordinates in a planar map. Finally, there are both projected and geographic coordinate systems that employ more complicated ellipsoids than a simple sphere to better approximate the 'potato-shaped' reality of our planet. The complete CRS information required to accurately relate geospatial information to a place on Earth includes both (projected/geographic) coordinate system and ellipsoid.\n",
    "\n",
    "Spatial datasets frequently have different CRSs since different coordinate systems are optimized for specific regions and purposes. No coordinate system can be entirely accurate around the world, and the transformation from three- to two-dimensional coordinates cannot be accurate in angles, distances, and areas at the same time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, it is a typical GIS task to transform, or reproject, a dataset from one reference system to another, such as to make two layers interoperable. Comparing two datasets with different CRSs would inevitably yield incorrect results; for instance, determining points contained within a polygon would not work if the points have geographic coordinates (in degrees), and the polygon is in the national Finnish reference system (in meters).\n",
    "\n",
    "Choosing an appropriate projection for your map is not always easy. It depends on what you want to represent in your map and what your data's spatial scale, resolution, and extent are. In reality, there is no single \"perfect projection\"; each has advantages and disadvantages, and you should choose a projection that best fits each map. "
